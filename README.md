# From College Boards to Dashboards: A Data Analysis Project

## About This Project

This project is my final submission for the AWS AI & ML Scholars program. I acted as a data analyst for a fictional community college to uncover insights from their student data. The goal was to identify key drivers of student success and provide actionable recommendations to improve retention and outcomes.

## Technologies Used

* **Amazon QuickSight:** The core business intelligence (BI) tool used for all data preparation, analysis, and visualization.
* **Amazon Q:** The built-in AI assistant in QuickSight that I used to ask natural language questions and automatically generate visuals.

## What I Did

* Prepared and cleaned the student enrollment dataset.
* Created several visuals and a full dashboard to explore relationships between professors, courses, costs, and student evaluations.
* Configured a custom Q Topic and Named Entities to make the AI assistant smarter and more accurate.
* Developed a "Data Story" to present my final recommendations in a clear, compelling narrative format.
